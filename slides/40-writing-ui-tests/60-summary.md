## Summary

- Start early with defining page objects and components
- Interface of page objects is functional
 - Not technical
 - Not driven by UI structure
- Keep tests short
- Don't test too much stuff

note:

rolf: 
- enough time to run a short demo test?
- maybe show how a test fails (something goes wrong in a page object?)?
- otherwise continue and dig into code later
