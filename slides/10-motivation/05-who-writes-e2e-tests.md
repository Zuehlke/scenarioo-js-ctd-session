## Who Should Write Tests?

* Only Special E2E Tester / Testing Team ?
    * NO! Take care of unnecessary Silos!

* **Tests should be primarily a Tool for the Dev Team!**
   * Developer can verify his changes
   * Developer can adjust tests where necessary
   * Developer gets feedback if tests broken
   * Tests are best written by Developers
   * Dedicated Testers
       * do manual testing and review the automated tests
       * help the dev team to build automated test suites
