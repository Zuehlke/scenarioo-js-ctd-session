## How to Keep Tests Green?

**Feature Branches and Pull Requests**

* Failed tests on feature Branches are ok!
* Failed tests on master / develop disturb others!

* Let CI Build System verify your Pull Requests 
   * automatically run all tests!
   * no merge when tests fail!
   * use it also for _Code Reviews_!
   
* Short Demo
