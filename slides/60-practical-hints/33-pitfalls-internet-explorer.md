## Internet Explorer Testing

   * Selenium for Internet Explorer is most unstable version   
   * IE testing is very hard!
      * writing working web pages for IE is allready hard
      * writing stable web tests for IE is even harder
      * you will fight with problems of the IE tooling
      * these are problems that are no "real bugs"!
   * Is it worth to go that extra mile?   
      * we recommend to focus on functional web tests with most stable tooling
      * prefer to use Firefox or Chrome for automated testing
      * cover IE by using it for additional manual tests
