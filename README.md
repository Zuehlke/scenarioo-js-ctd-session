Date of Session: 18.11.2016 13:30-15:00

Authors: Dominic Langenegger (@dola), Michael Werner (@mi-we) and Rolf Bruderer (@bruderol)

## Major Goals & Content

* Using Scenarioo JS, Protractor and Jasmine 2 to efficiently test and document web applications
* Best Practicces from real projects how to do this right and effective
* How to structure and design those tests for Maintainability and Stability
* Coding Examples

## Session Abstract

ScenariooJS, Protractor and Jasmine 2 are a perfect team to get your web applications tested and simultaneously documented from a user interface perspective. 

The session will focus on test design, since this is the most 
important part of successful and effective UI/E2E-Testing, and is as well useful for you if you are using any other UI Testing technologies (like pure Selenium).

We will discuss how to structure  these tests to get a well-organized test suite and system documentation from a user's point of view. 

Furthermore we will also present some useful protractor tips and tricks and best practices for writing stable and maintainable UI/E2E-Tests more efficiently and how to prevent falling into pitfalls.
