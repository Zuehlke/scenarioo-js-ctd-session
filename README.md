# ZE CTD Session: Effective UI Testing with ScenariooJS and Protractor

Material and Outcomes of the Client Tech Day Session 2016 in Zurich (Schlieren).

We make this currently as a private repo but might think about migrating it later to an open repo.

Date of Session: 18.11.2016 13:30-15:00

Authors: Dominic Langenegger (@dola), Michael Werner (@mi-we) and Rolf Bruderer (@bruderol)

Major Goal & Content: Using Scenarioo JS, Protractor and Jasmine 2 to efficiently test and document web applications form a user interface perspective and how to structure and design those tests.

## Session Abstract (as currently announced in the CTD program)

ScenariooJS, Protractor and Jasmine 2 are a perfect team to get your web applications tested and simultaneously documented from a user interface perspective for all your stakeholders. The session will primarily focus on test design, since this is the most 
important part of successful and effective UI/E2E-Testing, and is even important if you are using any other testing technologies (like pure Selenium). We will discuss examples from the Swisscom Cloud Portal poject and how Rolf structured these tests to get a well-organized test suite and system documentation from a user's point of view. Furthermore we will also present some useful 
protractor tips and tricks and best practices for writing stable and maintainable UI/E2E-Tests 
more efficiently. The session will be practically oriented with real examples from real projects 
and will also demonstrate some of the newest features of the Zühlke Open Source RUA Scenarioo.
